            to My dear lover Alliesa, In a world full of uncertain things, i want you to be my certainty. I just want you to know that this past 5 months have been the best moments i ever had during the Pandemic and you are certainly 95% the cause for this. You are my Happiness, strength, motivation and aswell as my greatest weakness. Its crazy to the point that if i ever get to travel back in time and tell my younger self to cheer up and prepare for the amazing woman he is about to meet in the future. My younger self would probably disregard it and shrug it off become its simply too good to be true XD. But here i am today believing that i am currently living one of the highest points of my life alongside someone who will probably play a big role in next following years. Thankyou alliesa, because of you i realized what really matters the most in life is people and your relations with them. You really make me happy from the first minute i wake up to say goodmorning to you until i fall asleep in our videocalls. Lover i really hope i reciprocate this feelings to you. I want to make you feel special, cherished and loved every single day because i think you deserve every single part of me and what i can offer you. Honestly you are the most empathetic, sweet and artistic person i ever knew, plus youuurrrr sooooo cute and stunningly gorgeous hahahahahahahahahahaha. I so blessed to have someone like you as my partner and honestly you changed my view on the ideal partner i want to be with and marry. You are also so open-minded! How did you learn to listen so well, when i tell you funny and embarassing stories i never feared that you will judge me! Its truely crazy to have someone like you. Alliesa Pauline Meer or Alliesa Pauline Garcia - Meer, its your choice hehehehehe. You really did convince me that what we have is really special and i want to nurture this connection with you until we grow older. I know that im still young at 18 years old to decide on things like this. However we i make big decisions i always decide on the facts rather than my passion for you. Even without the feelings im feeling with you i still see you as a great partner because you are someone i can truely be myself with. And i hope that i make you feel the same way. You make me feel safe with your soft and soothing words <3. You are also a good source of motivation to keep on going even during the hard times. I love you lover ko your so cute hahahahaah i could repeat those words over and over again just to remind you about how special you are to me hehehehehe. And Lastly, i want to know you more as an artist hehehehe i love watching you draw, its so soothing to predict where your next strokes will appear while you elaborate topics about art anatomy and how you implement them to your artwork. It makes my heart flutter by the fact that you are so into art hehehehe when you draw you look so focused and dreamy. It makes me want to lay my head in your lap while you draw your heart out. As always my lover i will forever be yours &hearts;.

I want to make you feel special, cherished and loved every single day because i think you deserve every single part of me and what i can offer you. Honestly you are the most empathetic, sweet and artistic person i ever knew, plus youuurrrr sooooo cute and stunningly gorgeous hahahahahahahahahahaha. I so blessed to have someone like you as my partner and honestly you changed my view on the ideal partner i want to be with and marry. You are also so open-minded! How did you learn to listen so well, when i tell you funny and embarassing stories i never feared that you will judge me! Its truely crazy to have someone like you. Alliesa Pauline Meer or Alliesa Pauline Garcia - Meer, its your choice hehehehehe. You really did convince me that what we have is really special and i want to nurture this connection with you until we grow older. I know that im still young at 18 years old to decide on things like this. However we i make big decisions i always decide on the facts rather than my passion for you. Even without the feelings im feeling with you i still see you as a great partner because you are someone i can truely be myself with. And i hope that i make you feel the same way. You make me feel safe with your soft and soothing words <3. You are also a good source of motivation to keep on going even during the hard times. I love you lover ko your so cute hahahahaah i could repeat those words over and over again just to remind you about how special you are to me hehehehehe. And Lastly, i want to know you more as an artist hehehehe i love watching you draw, its so soothing to predict where your next strokes will appear while you elaborate topics about art anatomy and how you implement them to your artwork. It makes my heart flutter by the fact that you are so into art hehehehe when you draw you look so focused and dreamy. It makes me want to lay my head in your lap while you draw your heart out. As always my lover i will forever be yours &hearts;.
            to My dear lover Alliesa, In a world full of uncertain things, i want you to be my certainty. I just want you to know that this past 5 months have been the best moments i ever had during the Pandemic and you are certainly 95% the cause for this. You are my Happiness, strength, motivation and aswell as my greatest weakness. Its crazy to the point that if i ever get to travel back in time and tell my younger self to cheer up and prepare for the amazing woman he is about to meet in the future. My younger self would probably disregard it and shrug it off become its simply too good to be true XD. But here i am today believing that i am currently living one of the highest points of my life alongside someone who will probably play a big role in next following years.

            to My dear lover Alliesa, In a world full of uncertain things, i want you to be my certainty. I just want you to know that this past 5 months have been the best moments i ever had during the Pandemic and you are certainly 95% the cause for this. You are my Happiness, strength, motivation and aswell as my greatest weakness. Its crazy to the point that if i ever get to travel back in time and tell my younger self to cheer up and prepare for the amazing woman he is about to meet in the future. My younger self would probably disregard it and shrug it off become its simply too good to be true XD. But here i am today believing that i am currently living one of the highest points of my life alongside someone who will probably play a big role in next following years. Thankyou alliesa, because of you i realized what really matters the most in life is people and your relations with them. You really make me happy from the first minute i wake up to say goodmorning to you until i fall asleep in our videocalls. Lover i really hope i reciprocate this feelings to you. I want to make you feel special, cherished and loved every single day because i think you deserve every single part of me and what i can offer you. Honestly you are the most empathetic, sweet and artistic person i ever knew, plus youuurrrr sooooo cute and stunningly gorgeous hahahahahahahahahahaha. I so blessed to have someone like you as my partner and honestly you changed my view on the ideal partner i want to be with and marry. You are also so open-minded! How did you learn to listen so well, when i tell you funny and embarassing stories i never feared that you will judge me! Its truely crazy to have someone like you. Alliesa Pauline Meer or Alliesa Pauline Garcia - Meer, its your choice hehehehehe. You really did convince me that what we have is really special and i want to nurture this connection with you until we grow older. I know that im still young at 18 years old to decide on things like this. However we i make big decisions i always decide on the facts rather than my passion for you. Even without the feelings im feeling with you i still see you as a great partner because you are someone i can truely be myself with. And i hope that i make you feel the same way.

I know that im still young at 18 years old to decide on things like this. However we i make big decisions i always decide on the facts rather than my passion for you. Even without the feelings im feeling with you i still see you as a great partner because you are someone i can truely be myself with. And i hope that i make you feel the same way. You make me feel safe with your soft and soothing words <3. You are also a good source of motivation to keep on going even during the hard times.

And Lastly, i want to know you more as an artist hehehehe i love watching you draw, its so soothing to predict where your next strokes will appear while you elaborate topics about art anatomy and how you implement them to your artwork. It makes my heart flutter by the fact that you are so into art hehehehe when you draw you look so focused and dreamy. It makes me want to lay my head in your lap while you draw your heart out.

I just want you to know that this past 5 months have been the best moments i ever had during the Pandemic and you are certainly 95% the cause for this. You are my Happiness, strength, motivation and aswell as my greatest weakness. Its crazy to the point that if i ever get to travel back in time and tell my younger self to cheer up and prepare for the amazing woman he is about to meet in the future. My younger self would probably disregard it and shrug it off become its simply too good to be true XD. But here i am today believing that i am currently living one of the highest points of my life alongside someone who will probably play a big role in next following years.

I just want you to know that this past 5 months have been the best moments i ever had during the Pandemic and you are certainly 95% the cause for this. You are my Happiness, strength, motivation and aswell as my greatest weakness. Its crazy to the point that if i ever get to travel back in time and tell my younger self to cheer up and prepare for the amazing woman he is about to meet in the future. My younger self would probably disregard it and shrug it off become its simply too good to be true XD. But here i am today believing that i am currently living one of the highest points of my life alongside someone who will probably play a big role in next following years. Thankyou alliesa, because of you i realized what really matters the most in life is people and your relations with them. You really make me happy from the first minute i wake up to say goodmorning to you until i fall asleep in our videocalls. Lover i really hope i reciprocate this feelings to you. I want to make you feel special, cherished and loved every single day because i think you deserve every single part of me and what i can offer you. Honestly you are the most empathetic, sweet and artistic person i ever knew, plus youuurrrr sooooo cute and stunningly gorgeous hahahahahahahahahahaha. I so blessed to have someone like you as my partner and honestly you changed my view on the ideal partner i want to be with and marry. You are also so open-minded! How did you learn to listen so well, when i tell you funny and embarassing stories i never feared that you will judge me! Its truely crazy to have someone like you. Alliesa Pauline Meer or Alliesa Pauline Garcia - Meer, its your choice hehehehehe. You really did convince me that what we have is really special and i want to nurture this connection with you until we grow older. I know that im still young at 18 years old to decide on things like this. However we i make big decisions i always decide on the facts rather than my passion for you. Even without the feelings im feeling with you i still see you as a great partner because you are someone i can truely be myself with. And i hope that i make you feel the same way. You make me feel safe with your soft and soothing words <3. You are also a good source of motivation to keep on going even during the hard times. I love you lover ko your so cute hahahahaah i could repeat those words over and over again just to remind you about how special you are to me hehehehehe. And Lastly, i want to know you more as an artist hehehehe i love watching you draw, its so soothing to predict where your next strokes will appear while you elaborate topics about art anatomy and how you implement them to your artwork. It makes my heart flutter by the fact that you are so into art hehehehe when you draw you look so focused and dreamy. It makes me want to lay my head in your lap while you draw your heart out. As always my lover i will forever be yours &hearts;.

How did you learn to listen so well, when i tell you funny and embarassing stories i never feared that you will judge me! Its truely crazy to have someone like you. Alliesa Pauline Meer or Alliesa Pauline Garcia - Meer, its your choice hehehehehe. You really did convince me that what we have is really special and i want to nurture this connection with you until we grow older. I know that im still young at 18 years old to decide on things like this. However we i make big decisions i always decide on the facts rather than my passion for you. Even without the feelings im feeling with you i still see you as a great partner because you are someone i can truely be myself with. And i hope that i make you feel the same way. You make me feel safe with your soft and soothing words <3. You are also a good source of motivation to keep on going even during the hard times. I love you lover ko your so cute hahahahaah i could repeat those words over and over again just to remind you about how special you are to me hehehehehe. And Lastly, i want to know you more as an artist hehehehe i love watching you draw, its so soothing to predict where your next strokes will appear while you elaborate topics about art anatomy and how you implement them to your artwork. It makes my heart flutter by the fact that you are so into art hehehehe when you draw you look so focused and dreamy. It makes me want to lay my head in your lap while you draw your heart out. As always my lover i will forever be yours &hearts;.
            to My dear lover Alliesa, In a world full of uncertain things, i want you to be my certainty. I just want you to know that this past 5 months have been the best moments i ever had during the Pandemic and you are certainly 95% the cause for this. You are my Happiness, strength, motivation and aswell as my greatest weakness. Its crazy to the point that if i ever get to travel back in time and tell my younger self to cheer up and prepare for the amazing woman he is about to meet in the future. My younger self would probably disregard it and shrug it off become its simply too good to be true XD. But here i am today believing that i am currently living one of the highest points of my life alongside someone who will probably play a big role in next following years. Thankyou alliesa, because of you i realized what really matters the most in life is people and your relations with them. You really make me happy from the first minute i wake up to say goodmorning to you until i fall asleep in our videocalls. Lover i really hope i reciprocate this feelings to you. I want to make you feel special, cherished and loved every single day because i think you deserve every single part of me and what i can offer you.

It makes my heart flutter by the fact that you are so into art hehehehe when you draw you look so focused and dreamy. It makes me want to lay my head in your lap while you draw your heart out. As always my lover i will forever be yours &hearts;.
            to My dear lover Alliesa, In a world full of uncertain things, i want you to be my certainty. I just want you to know that this past 5 months have been the best moments i ever had during the Pandemic and you are certainly 95% the cause for this. You are my Happiness, strength, motivation and aswell as my greatest weakness. Its crazy to the point that if i ever get to travel back in time and tell my younger self to cheer up and prepare for the amazing woman he is about to meet in the future. My younger self would probably disregard it and shrug it off become its simply too good to be true XD. But here i am today believing that i am currently living one of the highest points of my life alongside someone who will probably play a big role in next following years. Thankyou alliesa, because of you i realized what really matters the most in life is people and your relations with them. You really make me happy from the first minute i wake up to say goodmorning to you until i fall asleep in our videocalls. Lover i really hope i reciprocate this feelings to you. I want to make you feel special, cherished and loved every single day because i think you deserve every single part of me and what i can offer you. Honestly you are the most empathetic, sweet and artistic person i ever knew, plus youuurrrr sooooo cute and stunningly gorgeous hahahahahahahahahahaha. I so blessed to have someone like you as my partner and honestly you changed my view on the ideal partner i want to be with and marry. You are also so open-minded! How did you learn to listen so well, when i tell you funny and embarassing stories i never feared that you will judge me! Its truely crazy to have someone like you. Alliesa Pauline Meer or Alliesa Pauline Garcia - Meer, its your choice hehehehehe. You really did convince me that what we have is really special and i want to nurture this connection with you until we grow older. I know that im still young at 18 years old to decide on things like this. However we i make big decisions i always decide on the facts rather than my passion for you. Even without the feelings im feeling with you i still see you as a great partner because you are someone i can truely be myself with. And i hope that i make you feel the same way.

You really make me happy from the first minute i wake up to say goodmorning to you until i fall asleep in our videocalls. Lover i really hope i reciprocate this feelings to you. I want to make you feel special, cherished and loved every single day because i think you deserve every single part of me and what i can offer you. Honestly you are the most empathetic, sweet and artistic person i ever knew, plus youuurrrr sooooo cute and stunningly gorgeous hahahahahahahahahahaha. I so blessed to have someone like you as my partner and honestly you changed my view on the ideal partner i want to be with and marry. You are also so open-minded! How did you learn to listen so well, when i tell you funny and embarassing stories i never feared that you will judge me! Its truely crazy to have someone like you. Alliesa Pauline Meer or Alliesa Pauline Garcia - Meer, its your choice hehehehehe. You really did convince me that what we have is really special and i want to nurture this connection with you until we grow older. I know that im still young at 18 years old to decide on things like this. However we i make big decisions i always decide on the facts rather than my passion for you. Even without the feelings im feeling with you i still see you as a great partner because you are someone i can truely be myself with. And i hope that i make you feel the same way. You make me feel safe with your soft and soothing words <3. You are also a good source of motivation to keep on going even during the hard times. I love you lover ko your so cute hahahahaah i could repeat those words over and over again just to remind you about how special you are to me hehehehehe. And Lastly, i want to know you more as an artist hehehehe i love watching you draw, its so soothing to predict where your next strokes will appear while you elaborate topics about art anatomy and how you implement them to your artwork. It makes my heart flutter by the fact that you are so into art hehehehe when you draw you look so focused and dreamy. It makes me want to lay my head in your lap while you draw your heart out. As always my lover i will forever be yours &hearts;.
            to My dear lover Alliesa, In a world full of uncertain things, i want you to be my certainty. I just want you to know that this past 5 months have been the best moments i ever had during the Pandemic and you are certainly 95% the cause for this. You are my Happiness, strength, motivation and aswell as my greatest weakness. Its crazy to the point that if i ever get to travel back in time and tell my younger self to cheer up and prepare for the amazing woman he is about to meet in the future. My younger self would probably disregard it and shrug it off become its simply too good to be true XD.

You make me feel safe with your soft and soothing words <3. You are also a good source of motivation to keep on going even during the hard times. I love you lover ko your so cute hahahahaah i could repeat those words over and over again just to remind you about how special you are to me hehehehehe. And Lastly, i want to know you more as an artist hehehehe i love watching you draw, its so soothing to predict where your next strokes will appear while you elaborate topics about art anatomy and how you implement them to your artwork. It makes my heart flutter by the fact that you are so into art hehehehe when you draw you look so focused and dreamy. It makes me want to lay my head in your lap while you draw your heart out. As always my lover i will forever be yours &hearts;.
            to My dear lover Alliesa, In a world full of uncertain things, i want you to be my certainty. I just want you to know that this past 5 months have been the best moments i ever had during the Pandemic and you are certainly 95% the cause for this. You are my Happiness, strength, motivation and aswell as my greatest weakness. Its crazy to the point that if i ever get to travel back in time and tell my younger self to cheer up and prepare for the amazing woman he is about to meet in the future. My younger self would probably disregard it and shrug it off become its simply too good to be true XD. But here i am today believing that i am currently living one of the highest points of my life alongside someone who will probably play a big role in next following years. Thankyou alliesa, because of you i realized what really matters the most in life is people and your relations with them. You really make me happy from the first minute i wake up to say goodmorning to you until i fall asleep in our videocalls. Lover i really hope i reciprocate this feelings to you. I want to make you feel special, cherished and loved every single day because i think you deserve every single part of me and what i can offer you. Honestly you are the most empathetic, sweet and artistic person i ever knew, plus youuurrrr sooooo cute and stunningly gorgeous hahahahahahahahahahaha. I so blessed to have someone like you as my partner and honestly you changed my view on the ideal partner i want to be with and marry. You are also so open-minded! How did you learn to listen so well, when i tell you funny and embarassing stories i never feared that you will judge me! Its truely crazy to have someone like you. Alliesa Pauline Meer or Alliesa Pauline Garcia - Meer, its your choice hehehehehe. You really did convince me that what we have is really special and i want to nurture this connection with you until we grow older.
